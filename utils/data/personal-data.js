  description: "I'm a Computer Science graduate passionate about building intelligent, scalable backend systems that solve real-world problems. With hands-on experience in Python, Node.js, FastAPI, Java, SQL, and React, I’ve developed production-grade REST APIs, microservices, and AI-integrated web applications. From crafting a full-fledged Order Management System to designing an AI-powered Traffic Signal Control using Deep Reinforcement Learning, I bring a blend of backend engineering and AI creativity to the table. Currently exploring how AI can seamlessly integrate with scalable web systems — from predictive dashboards to LLM-powered APIs. I'm open to full-time backend roles, AI-driven product development, and research opportunities where innovation meets impact.",
